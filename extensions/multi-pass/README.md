# pi-multi-pass

Multi-subscription extension for [pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-coding-agent) -- use multiple OAuth accounts per provider with automatic rate-limit rotation and project-level affinity.

This is the maintained fork inside the Pi configuration repository. It keeps
the upstream behavior and adds Pi 0.84.2 auth compatibility. The parent
package manifest loads this extension directly.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:pi-multi-pass
```

Or via git:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/hjanuschka/pi-multi-pass
```

## Features

- **Multiple subscriptions**: Add extra OAuth accounts for any provider
- **Rotation pools**: Group subscriptions and auto-rotate on rate limits
- **Smart pool strategies**: `round-robin`, `quota-first`, `scheduled` (time windows), `custom` (JS script hook)
- **Fallback chains**: Define ordered cross-pool/model failover via `/pool chain`
- **Model presets**: Named routing shortcuts across providers (`/mp-preset coding-premium`)
- **Built-in limits checks**: Inspect subscription headroom across accounts with `/subs limits`
- **Smarter retries**: Preserve failover progress across internal replay retries
- **Project affinity**: Restrict which subs/pools/chains are used per project
- **TUI management**: `/subs`, `/pool`, and `/mp-preset` commands -- no config files needed
- **Labels**: Tag subscriptions (e.g. "work", "personal")

## Quick start

```
/subs add              Pick a provider, add a subscription
/login                 Authenticate the new subscription
/subs switch           Manually switch to another subscription/provider
/subs limits           Check built-in quota support (Codex + Google)
/pool create           Group subs into a rotation pool (with strategy selection)
/pool chain create     Build an ordered fallback chain across pools
/mp-preset create         Create a named routing preset across providers
/mp-preset coding-premium Activate a preset by name
```

When one account hits a rate limit during an assistant turn, multi-pass automatically switches to the next eligible target and retries.

## Project-level configuration

Use `/pool project` to configure per-project subscription affinity. This creates `.pi/multi-pass.json` in your project directory.

When `allowedSubs` is set, multi-pass now treats it as an exact allow-list for this project: active routing, pool membership, and chain traversal are all constrained to those provider names.

### Use case: separate work and personal accounts

```
# Global: you have 3 Codex accounts
/subs add   -> openai-codex-2 (label: work)
/subs add   -> openai-codex-3 (label: personal)

# Corp project: restrict to team accounts only
cd ~/work/corp-project
/pool project -> restrict -> select openai-codex-2 only

# Side project: allow everything (no restriction)
cd ~/side-project
# No .pi/multi-pass.json needed -- uses all global subs
```

### What project config can do

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Restrict subs** | Only allow specific provider names in this project (for example `openai-codex-2` or `openai-codex`) |
| **Override pools** | Use different pools than global (or disable some) |
| **Override chains** | Use different fallback chains than global |
| **Clear** | Remove project config, fall back to global |
| **Info** | Show effective config (which pools/chains/subs are active) |

### Project config file

`.pi/multi-pass.json`:

```json
{
  "allowedSubs": ["openai-codex-2", "anthropic-2"],
  "pools": [
    {
      "name": "work-codex",
      "baseProvider": "openai-codex",
      "members": ["openai-codex-2"],
      "enabled": true
    }
  ],
  "chains": [
    {
      "name": "work-fallback",
      "enabled": true,
      "entries": [
        { "pool": "work-codex", "model": "gpt-5-mini", "enabled": true }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

- `allowedSubs`: whitelist of exact provider names. If set, only those exact providers are available in this project. Omit to allow all.
- `pools`: if set, replaces global pools for this project. Omit to inherit global pools.
- `chains`: if set, replaces global chains for this project. Omit to inherit global chains.

## How pools work

1. You're using `openai-codex` and hit a rate limit
2. Multi-pass detects the error, marks `openai-codex` as exhausted
3. Switches to `openai-codex-2` (same model ID, different account)
4. Retries your last prompt automatically
5. After a 5-minute cooldown, `openai-codex` becomes available again

### Pool selection strategy

Each pool has a `strategy` that controls how the next member is chosen on failover:

| Strategy | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `round-robin` | Rotate sequentially through members (default) |
| `quota-first` | Query built-in quota checkers and prefer the member with the most remaining quota |
| `scheduled` | Use per-member time windows and priority roles |
| `custom` | Delegate to a user-provided JS selector script |

Set the strategy during pool creation (`/pool create`) or change it later via `/pool list` -> select pool -> `strategy`.

All strategies fall back to round-robin when their specific data is unavailable.

#### `quota-first`

You have 3 Codex accounts in a pool. Account A has 80% of its 5-hour window left, account B has 20%, account C has 60%. On failover, `quota-first` picks account A first instead of just the next one in rotation order.

Uses the same built-in quota checkers as `/subs limits` (currently Codex and Google providers).

```json
{
  "name": "codex-pool",
  "baseProvider": "openai-codex",
  "members": ["openai-codex", "openai-codex-2", "openai-codex-3"],
  "enabled": true,
  "strategy": "quota-first"
}
```

#### `scheduled`

Assign each member a role and optional time windows:

- **preferred**: only used during its active windows. When multiple preferred members are active, the one whose window ends soonest goes first (burn that quota before the window closes).
- **default** (no role): always available, used after preferred members.
- **overflow**: last resort, used when preferred and default members are exhausted.

```json
{
  "name": "codex-pool",
  "baseProvider": "openai-codex",
  "members": ["openai-codex", "openai-codex-2", "openai-codex-3"],
  "enabled": true,
  "strategy": "scheduled",
  "memberSchedule": {
    "openai-codex": {
      "role": "preferred",
      "windows": [{ "hours": [9, 17], "days": ["mon", "tue", "wed", "thu", "fri"] }]
    },
    "openai-codex-2": {
      "role": "preferred",
      "windows": [{ "hours": [17, 9] }]
    },
    "openai-codex-3": {
      "role": "overflow"
    }
  }
}
```

Window format:
- `hours`: `[start, end)` in 24h local time. Wraps midnight when start > end (e.g. `[22, 6]` = 22:00-05:59).
- `days`: array of `"mon"`, `"tue"`, ..., `"sun"`. Omit for every day.
- `dateRange`: `{ "from": "2025-06-01", "to": "2025-06-30" }` for temporary windows.

During pool creation or via the `strategy` quick action, you can configure schedules interactively with human-friendly input like `9-17 mon-fri`.

#### `custom`

Point to a JS script that decides which member to try first. The script receives full context and returns the preferred provider name (or an ordered array).

```json
{
  "name": "codex-pool",
  "baseProvider": "openai-codex",
  "members": ["openai-codex", "openai-codex-2", "openai-codex-3"],
  "enabled": true,
  "strategy": "custom",
  "selectorScript": "selectors/my-codex-selector.js"
}
```

Script paths are resolved relative to `~/.pi/agent/`. Absolute paths and `~/` paths also work.

**Selector script interface:**

```js
// ~/.pi/agent/selectors/my-codex-selector.js
module.exports = async function select(ctx) {
  // ctx.members:         string[]  -- available (non-exhausted, authenticated) members
  // ctx.currentProvider: string    -- the provider that just hit a rate limit
  // ctx.modelId:         string    -- the model ID being used
  // ctx.pool:            object    -- { name, baseProvider, members }
  // ctx.timestamp:       number    -- current Unix timestamp (ms)
  // ctx.hour:            number    -- current hour (0-23, local time)
  // ctx.day:             string    -- current day of week ("mon".."sun")
  // ctx.prompt:          string?   -- last user prompt, if available
  //
  // Return: string (provider name), string[] (ordered preference), or undefined (fall back)

  // Example: prefer a specific account during business hours
  if (ctx.hour >= 9 && ctx.hour < 17) {
    return ctx.members.find(m => m === "openai-codex-2");
  }
  return ctx.members[0];
};
```

If the script throws, returns an invalid provider name, or the file is missing, the pool falls back to round-robin.

## How chains work

1. You define an ordered chain of pool/model entries (for example `primary -> backup -> solo`)
2. If the current pool has no eligible members, multi-pass continues forward in the chain
3. It skips disabled or invalid entries and reports why in warnings
4. During retry replays for the same prompt, it preserves cascade state and avoids re-trying already attempted providers
5. Session status shows the active chain start entry: `chain:<name> | starts <pool> -> <model>`

## Model presets

Presets are named routing shortcuts that map to an ordered list of provider+model entries across different providers. Think of them as intent-based routing: `coding-premium`, `coding-budget`, `fastest`, etc.

### Commands

```
/mp-preset              Open menu
/mp-preset activate     Switch to a preset's best available entry
/mp-preset <name>       Activate a preset by name directly
/mp-preset create       Create a new preset
/mp-preset list         Show all presets
/mp-preset toggle       Enable/disable a preset
/mp-preset remove       Delete a preset
```

### Example

```
/mp-preset create
  Name: coding-premium
  Entries:
    1. anthropic / claude-sonnet-4-20250514
    2. openai-codex / o3
    3. google-gemini-cli / gemini-2.5-pro

/mp-preset coding-premium
  -> Tries anthropic first. If not logged in, tries openai-codex. Then gemini.
```

### Config

Presets are stored in `~/.pi/agent/multi-pass.json`:

```json
{
  "presets": [
    {
      "name": "coding-premium",
      "enabled": true,
      "entries": [
        { "provider": "anthropic", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "enabled": true },
        { "provider": "openai-codex", "model": "o3", "enabled": true },
        { "provider": "google-gemini-cli", "model": "gemini-2.5-pro", "enabled": true }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "coding-budget",
      "enabled": true,
      "entries": [
        { "provider": "openai-codex", "model": "gpt-4.1-mini", "enabled": true },
        { "provider": "google-gemini-cli", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "enabled": true }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Presets work with pools: if an entry's provider belongs to a pool, rate-limit failover still rotates within that pool before trying the next preset entry.

## Supported providers

| Provider key | Service |
|---|---|
| `anthropic` | Claude Pro/Max |
| `openai-codex` | ChatGPT Plus/Pro (Codex) |
| `github-copilot` | GitHub Copilot |
| `google-gemini-cli` | Google Cloud Code Assist |
| `google-antigravity` | Antigravity |

## Built-in limits support

`/subs limits` uses a provider-specific checker registry.

Currently implemented:

- `openai-codex`: fetches ChatGPT/Codex usage from `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/wham/usage` (or `CHATGPT_BASE_URL`), then summarizes the 5-hour and 7-day subscription windows for the base account and any configured extra Codex subscriptions.
- `google-gemini-cli`: refreshes the saved Google OAuth session when needed, then queries `https://cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com/v1internal:retrieveUserQuota` and summarizes the returned Gemini quota buckets by their bottleneck family (for example `Pro` or `Flash`).
- `google-antigravity`: refreshes the saved Antigravity OAuth session when needed, then queries `v1internal:fetchAvailableModels` on the Google Cloud Code Assist endpoints with Antigravity-style headers and summarizes the returned model-level bottleneck.

Google quota is not a single flat subscription bucket, so the details view shows one line per returned Gemini family or Antigravity model with its remaining headroom and reset time.

`/subs limits` is an on-demand snapshot. It helps you see which account looks healthiest right now. Automatic switching still happens when the active provider returns a rate-limit-style runtime error and that provider belongs to an enabled pool or chain.

When a pool uses the `quota-first` strategy, the same quota checkers are used automatically during failover to pick the healthiest member instead of just round-robin.

When a project defines `.pi/multi-pass.json` with `allowedSubs`, `/subs limits` only shows accounts allowed in that project.

Future providers can add another checker without changing the `/subs` command surface.

## Environment variable (optional)

```bash
export MULTI_SUB="openai-codex:2,anthropic:1"
```

Env entries merge with saved config.

## Config files

| File | Scope | Contains |
|---|---|---|
| `~/.pi/agent/multi-pass.json` | Global | Subscriptions + pools + chains |
| `.pi/multi-pass.json` | Project | Pool/chain overrides + sub restrictions |
