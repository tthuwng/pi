# pi-rewind

Checkpoint/rewind extension for the [Pi coding agent](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono). Creates automatic git-based snapshots of your working tree, allowing you to rewind file changes and conversation state when the AI makes mistakes.

## Why

Every major coding agent now has rewind/undo: Claude Code (`/rewind`), Gemini CLI (`/rewind`), OpenCode (`/undo`), Cline (Checkpoints). Pi already has community extensions for this — [checkpoint-pi](https://github.com/prateekmedia/pi-hooks/tree/main/checkpoint) and [pi-rewind-hook](https://github.com/nicobailon/pi-rewind-hook) — but neither offers a dedicated `/rewind` command, diff preview, or a redo stack.

**pi-rewind** combines the best of both existing extensions with features from the top agents, closing every gap in one package.

## Features

- [x] Dedicated `/rewind` command — checkpoint browser → diff preview → restore
- [x] `Esc+Esc` keyboard shortcut — quick files-only rewind
- [x] Smart checkpointing — snapshots after write/edit/bash tools, 1 per turn
- [x] Smart dedup — skips checkpoints when worktree unchanged (read-only bash like `ls`, `find`, `cat` don't create checkpoints)
- [x] Descriptive labels — separate `Conversation:` prompt from `Files/tools:` activity with relative dates
- [x] Explicit preview before restore — see conversation target and file diff before choosing restore mode
- [x] Branch labels in picker — `[feature]` for same-branch, `⚠️ main` for cross-branch
- [x] Redo stack (multi-level undo) — "↩ Undo last rewind" in all flows
- [x] Restore options: files + conversation, files only, conversation only
- [x] Safe restore — never deletes `node_modules`, `.venv`, or large files
- [x] Branch safety — blocks cross-branch restore (avoids OpenCode bug)
- [x] Smart filtering — excludes 13 dir patterns, files >10MiB, dirs >200 files
- [x] Git-based checkpoints stored as refs (survives restarts)
- [x] Footer status indicator (`◆ X checkpoints`)
- [x] Auto-prune old sessions — deletes checkpoints from previous sessions on startup
- [x] Auto-prune per session — 50 max checkpoints per session
- [x] Resume checkpoint on session start
- [x] Fork/tree integration — restore prompts on `/fork` and `/tree` navigation
- [ ] "Summarize from here" integration (`ctx.compact()`)

## Install

```bash
# From npm
pi install npm:pi-rewind

# From GitHub
pi install github.com/arpagon/pi-rewind

# For development
git clone git@github.com:arpagon/pi-rewind.git
pi -e ./pi-rewind/src/index.ts
```

## Performance

Tested on repos from 20 files to 182K files (87GB monorepo):

| Repo                             | createCheckpoint | loadAll (startup) |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Small (20 files)                 | 62ms             | 8ms               |
| Medium (500 files)               | 62ms             | 8ms               |
| Large (5,000 files)              | 60ms             | 8ms               |
| Real monorepo (182K files, 87GB) | 142ms            | 8ms               |

- `createCheckpoint` = ~60-142ms constant → direct latency added per turn (imperceptible)
- Pi executes extension handlers with `await` sequentially, so this is the actual overhead
- Old sessions are auto-pruned on startup (525 stale refs → 0 in real-world test)

Run the benchmark yourself: `npx tsx tests/bench.ts`

## Architecture

Two-layer split: `core.ts` is pure git operations with zero Pi dependency (independently testable), `index.ts` wires Pi events to core functions.

```

## Development

```bash
# Run tests
npx tsx tests/core.test.ts

# Run benchmarks
npx tsx tests/bench.ts

# Test with Pi
pi -e ./src/index.ts
```

## Lineage

This project builds on research and code from:

- **[checkpoint-pi](https://github.com/prateekmedia/pi-hooks/tree/main/checkpoint)** by prateekmedia — Two-layer architecture, safe restore, smart filtering, unit tests (base)
- **[pi-rewind-hook](https://github.com/nicobailon/pi-rewind-hook)** by nicobailon — Resume checkpoints, footer status, notifications, auto-pruning (UX inspiration)

And draws feature parity targets from:

- Claude Code `/rewind` — Summarize from here, double-escape trigger
- Gemini CLI `/rewind` + `/restore` — Separate restore commands
- Cline Checkpoints — Per-tool checkpointing, Compare/Restore UI
- OpenCode `/undo` + `/redo` — Step-level patches, redo stack
