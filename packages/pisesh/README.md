**Bookmark, search, and resume [pi coding-agent](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) sessions with a fast keyboard-driven TUI.**

> `pi --resume` lists every session you ever started. After a week that's 50+ entries with no titles, no tags, and no order, so you just scroll and hope. pisesh adds what was missing: ⭐ favorites, instant search, and a `[NOW]` badge for the session you're attached to.

## Preview

<p align="center">

</p>

<p align="center"><sub>Real capture: ★ starred session at the top, the rest available behind the <b>Today</b>, <b>Here</b>, and <b>All</b> tabs. <code>Tab</code> cycles. <code>f</code> stars. <code>Enter</code> resumes.</sub></p>

## Terminal walkthrough

What the TUI looks like, screen by screen. The data below is made up, not real sessions.

**Main list.** The highlighted row is the current selection, and `Tab` cycles through the tabs. The green `[NOW]` badge marks the pi session you launched from, and the cyan `✎` marks a session you renamed yourself. CJK titles stay column-aligned:

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blue-B/pisesh/main/assets/screen-list.png" alt="pisesh main list, Favorites tab with Today / Here / All tabs, the NOW badge, and a renamed session" width="100%"></p>

**`e` renames a session.** The first user prompt makes a poor title for a thread you keep coming back to, so press `e` to set your own. It's saved as an override (the session jsonl is never touched) and the session gets a `✎` marker in the list:

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blue-B/pisesh/main/assets/screen-rename.png" alt="pisesh edit-name panel for setting a custom display title" width="100%"></p>

**`p` re-points the working directory metadata** through an arrow-key directory browser. This controls the `Here` tab and the cwd used when spawning a separate `pi` process for a different session; Pi still restores the session from its JSONL file. Press `s` to lock in the highlighted directory:

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blue-B/pisesh/main/assets/screen-cwd.png" alt="pisesh cwd browser, an arrow-key directory picker for the resume and Here directory" width="100%"></p>

The **`Here` tab** shows only sessions whose effective cwd matches the directory you launched pisesh from. Inside a project you see just that project's threads, without scrolling past your home-dir scratch sessions.

## Why pisesh

Pi accumulates sessions across many working directories: your home, several project dirs, scratch tmux panes. The built-in resume picker is roughly alphabetical and forgets context. After a few weeks:

- You can't tell which session was "the one where you fixed the auth bug"
- You can't pin the 3-4 long-running threads you keep going back to
- You re-open the wrong session and pollute it with unrelated context
- You waste time searching by timestamp guessing

pisesh is a **single-file Node script** (no dependencies, ~900 LoC) that gives you everything `pi --resume` doesn't.

### Value at a glance

| Need                                       | What you get                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mark important sessions                    | ⭐ Star/unstar with one keystroke; favorites persist to one global JSON       |
| Give a thread a real name                  | `e` sets a custom title (marked `✎`); overrides the first-prompt label        |
| See only the current project's sessions    | `Here` tab filters to sessions whose cwd matches where you launched pisesh   |
| Adjust session cwd metadata                | `p` opens an arrow-key directory browser; updates the `Here` tab/spawn cwd metadata |
| Find a session by what you said            | `/` searches id + project + first user prompt + custom title                 |
| Know which session you're attached to      | `[NOW]` badge on the live session (passed from pi via env var)               |
| Keep your terminal clean                   | Alt-screen buffer, so quitting puts your terminal back the way it was (like vim) |
| Read Korean / Chinese / Japanese prompts   | Display-width-aware truncation; columns never blow up on CJK                 |
| Open from anywhere                         | Run as standalone `pisesh` shell command, or `/sesh` inside pi               |
| Zero install pain                          | No build step, no native deps, runs on Node 18+ everywhere                   |
| Trust cleanup boundaries                   | pisesh only deletes after a type-to-confirm manifest; arbitrary project files mentioned in a conversation are not inferred as artifacts |

## Getting started

> Repo-local note: this Pi config uses the vendored `packages/pisesh` entry in `settings.json` so local fixes are loaded directly. The `npm:pisesh` command below is for installing the upstream package outside this repo.

### Quick install (recommended)

```bash
# Install both the CLI and the /sesh slash command in one go
pi install npm:pisesh
```

This registers pisesh as a pi extension. Inside any pi session, type `/sesh`.

### Standalone CLI only

```bash
npm install -g pisesh
pisesh
```

Use this if you want pisesh as a separate shell command and don't need the pi slash binding.

### From source (developers)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Blue-B/pisesh.git
cd pisesh
npm link            # symlink ./bin/pisesh into your global PATH
pisesh --help
```

Pi-extension side: drop `extensions/sesh.ts` into `~/.pi/agent/extensions/` and run `/reload` inside pi.

| `Tab` / `h` / `l`            | switch tab (`★ Favorites` → `Today` → `Here` → `All`)         |
| `f` / `Space`                | star / unstar the selected session                           |
| `Enter`                      | resume another session via `pi --session <session-file> --session-dir <dir>`; selecting `[NOW]` exits back to the current Pi |
| `e`                          | edit name: set a custom display title, shown with `✎` in the list |
| `p`                          | edit cwd metadata with an arrow-key directory browser; affects `Here` / spawned process cwd |
| `d`                          | session details (full prompt, file, byte size, timestamps)   |
| `X`                          | cleanup selected session + known associated artifacts; blocked for `[NOW]`; type `DELETE` to confirm |
| `/`                          | search by id / project / first user prompt / custom title    |
| `Esc`                        | clear search first, then quit                                |
| `q` / `Ctrl-C`               | quit (terminal restored)                                     |
| `r`                          | rescan session files (after pi starts a new session)         |
| `c` (in details view)        | copy session id to clipboard (clip.exe / pbcopy / xclip)     |
| `Home` `End` `PgUp` `PgDn`   | jump to top / bottom / ±10                                   |


## Cleanup limits

Press `X` on a selected session to preview cleanup. pisesh shows a manifest with paths and sizes, then requires typing `DELETE` before removing anything. Cleanup is blocked for the attached `[NOW]` session.

The cleanup action removes only known associated files:

- the selected session JSONL;
- that session's pisesh favorite/title/cwd metadata entries;
- matching Pi/Slipstream compaction artifacts under Pi's central compaction root and the session's recorded-cwd `.scratch/compactions` root;
- the Slipstream per-session stats JSONL;
- sibling subagent child-session trees stored next to the parent session file;
- exact subagent async-run directories parsed from the session file when they are under known `pi-subagents` temp roots.

It deliberately does **not** delete arbitrary project files mentioned by the conversation. Pi sessions do not contain a complete ledger of every file a tool may have created.

## CLI (non-TUI) usage

For scripts and automation:

```bash
pisesh --list                  # print starred session IDs (one per line)
pisesh --json                  # current favorites set as JSON
pisesh --star <partial-uuid>   # star a session from a script
pisesh --unstar <partial-uuid> # unstar
pisesh --help
```

### What it explicitly does **not** depend on

- No `npm install` for the bundled CLI runtime; it's genuinely zero-dependency
- No native binaries / GPU / ffmpeg / database
- No network calls, no telemetry, no analytics
- No daemon / background process

## Storage

| What       | Where                                                       |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Favorites  | `~/.pi/agent/favorites.json`                                |
| Overrides  | `~/.pi/agent/pisesh-meta.json` (per-session custom title / cwd, keyed by session id) |
| Sessions   | `~/.pi/agent/sessions/<projectSlug>/<timestamp>_<uuid>.jsonl` (pi's native layout; only the explicit cleanup flow deletes selected session files) |

Favorites file shape:

```json
{
  "ids": [
    "019e79b9-d2c1-741f-81ea-1dcad9a2d712",
    "019e6355-9957-7a30-b4ce-b9db5e3c9ac6"
  ],
  "updated": "2026-05-31T01:33:21.234Z"
}
```

It's a single global file (not per-project). Back it up by syncing one file.

## CJK-aware rendering

Korean / Chinese / Japanese / fullwidth characters render **2 cells wide** in terminals; pisesh measures display width (not JavaScript code-unit length) when truncating and padding. Korean prompts never wrap, columns stay aligned, and the layout looks identical whether the prompt is `hello world` or `안녕하세요 세상`.

```text
✓ webapp          로그인 폼 만들고 인증 엔드포인트 연결…
✓ 가계부앱         이번 달 지출 분석 화면 설계…
✓ docs-site       시작하기 가이드 다시 작성…
```

(Previously: Korean prompts overflowed to a second line and broke the table.)

## Requirements

- **Node.js ≥ 18** (uses optional chaining and `for…of` on strings, so no transpile step)
- A terminal with ANSI escape and alternate screen buffer support, which covers basically every modern emulator:
  - Windows: **Windows Terminal**, **WezTerm**, **Alacritty** ✅
  - macOS: **iTerm2**, **Terminal.app**, **WezTerm**, **Alacritty**, **Kitty** ✅
  - Linux: **GNOME Terminal**, **Konsole**, **xterm**, **Alacritty**, **Kitty** ✅
- [`pi`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent) on `$PATH` for the `Enter`-to-resume action

## Support

If pisesh saves you context-switching time or just makes pi nicer to live in, supporting it directly accelerates development:

- Your support helps: bug fixes, new keybindings, more search modes, integration with other pi extensions.
- Transparency: I don't sell data; funds go to development time and a coffee or two.
- One-time sponsors are credited in README and release notes (opt-out available).
- Monthly sponsors ($3/mo via GitHub Sponsors) get best-effort priority triage for "Sponsor Request" issues.
