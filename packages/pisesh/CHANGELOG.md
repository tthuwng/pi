# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.9-orestes.0] — 2026-06-11

### Added
- Local config patch: `X` opens a type-to-confirm cleanup preview for the selected session. Cleanup removes the selected session JSONL, pisesh metadata entries, and known associated Pi artifacts only.
- Cleanup is blocked for the attached `[NOW]` session and uses trash (`trash`, `trash-put`, or `gio trash`) before falling back to direct deletion.

### Changed
- The `/sesh` extension in this local package spawns the vendored `bin/pisesh` script directly instead of resolving `pisesh` from `$PATH`.

## [0.1.9] — 2026-06-03

### Fixed
- Name / cwd editor (`e`) now has a real caret. Arrow keys (and `Home` / `End`) move inside the text you already typed, so you can insert or delete in the middle instead of only at the end. Backspace, forward `Delete`, and inserts all act at the caret. Cursor moves by whole code points, so CJK and emoji never get split.

## [0.1.4] — 2026-06-03

### Added
- **`Here` tab** — filters the list to sessions whose effective cwd matches the directory pisesh was launched from. Tab order is now **★ Favorites → Today → Here → All**.
- **Inline rename (`e`)** — set a custom display title that overrides the first-prompt label; renamed sessions are marked with a cyan `✎` in the list.
- **Edit cwd (`p`)** — arrow-key directory browser to re-point the working directory pi resumes into (also drives the `Here` filter).
- Per-session overrides (custom title / cwd) persist to `~/.pi/agent/pisesh-meta.json`, keyed by session id. Session jsonl files remain read-only.
- README terminal screenshots for the list view, rename panel, and cwd browser.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-31

Initial release.

### Added
- `pisesh` CLI binary — keyboard-driven TUI that lists every pi session under `~/.pi/agent/sessions/`
- Tabs: **★ Favorites**, **Today**, **All**
- Star / unstar with `f` or Space; favorites persist to `~/.pi/agent/favorites.json`
- Search across id / project / first user prompt with `/`
- Session details view (`d`): full prompt, file path, byte size, timestamps
- `Enter` resumes a different selected session via `pi --session <session-file> --session-dir <dir>`; selecting `[NOW]` exits back to the current Pi without spawning a nested owner
- `[NOW]` badge marks the session belonging to the pi instance that spawned pisesh (set via `PISESH_CURRENT_SESSION` env var)
- Alternate screen buffer (`\x1b[?1049h`) — exit restores terminal byte-for-byte; no scrollback pollution
- CJK-aware truncation and padding (Hangul / CJK ideographs / emoji counted as 2 cells)
- Signal handlers (`SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`, `exit`) restore cursor + main buffer on unexpected exit
- Non-TUI CLI: `--list`, `--json`, `--star <id>`, `--unstar <id>`, `--help`
- Pi extension at `extensions/sesh.ts` — registers `/sesh` slash command which spawns pisesh inside pi via `ui.custom` + `tui.stop()`
