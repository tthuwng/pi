# 🌐 pi-chrome-devtools — Chrome DevTools Tools for Pi Agents

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@narumitw/pi-chrome-devtools)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@narumitw/pi-chrome-devtools) [![Pi extension](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pi-extension-blue)](https://pi.dev) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)](./LICENSE)

`@narumitw/pi-chrome-devtools` is a native [Pi coding agent](https://pi.dev) extension that exposes Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) automation as Pi tools.

Use it to let the Pi agent inspect browser tabs, navigate pages, evaluate JavaScript, and capture screenshots while debugging web apps or validating UI behavior.

This package is inspired by [`chrome-devtools-mcp`](https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp), but it is implemented as native Pi tools instead of an MCP server.

## ✨ Features

- Lists inspectable Chrome tabs and pages.
- Selects an active Chrome page for later tool calls.
- Navigates Chrome to a target URL, creating an inspectable page when none exists.
- Recovers from stale active page selections by falling back to an available page.
- Evaluates JavaScript in the selected page.
- Captures PNG screenshots, including optional full-page screenshots, and saves them to disk.
- Renders compact tool results that expand/collapse with Pi's default output toggle (`Ctrl+O`).
- Reuses an existing Chrome DevTools Protocol endpoint when one is already available.
- Lazily auto-launches a Chromium-family browser for missing local endpoints, with Chrome,
  Chromium, Brave, and Edge fallbacks.
- Loads one or more user-approved unpacked extensions into an isolated managed Chrome for Testing
  or Chromium browser.
- Uses a dynamic managed DevTools port by default to avoid port conflicts, while preserving
  explicit endpoint overrides.
- Retries briefly while Chrome is starting and reports actionable endpoint errors.
- Shows statusline activity only while Chrome DevTools tools are running.
- Keeps one loader tool active and exposes matching browser capabilities only when the agent needs them.
- Provides a state-first `/chrome-devtools` menu for tool availability, editable browser settings,
  browser status, setup, and help.
- Stages menu-based availability changes for exact review before one confirmed apply.
- Uses `@narumitw/pi-tui-kit` for width-safe TUI menus and equivalent RPC dialogs.
- Persists the Chrome DevTools lazy-load catalog across Pi restarts.

```

## 🚀 Browser startup

Without unpacked extensions, the extension first tries `browser.endpoint`, defaulting to
`http://127.0.0.1:9222`. If that local endpoint is unavailable and `browser.autoLaunch` is `true`, it
lazily launches an extension-owned Chromium-family browser with an isolated temp profile and retries
the CDP request. Existing endpoints are reused and are never terminated by the extension.

Configure the canonical user file at
`${PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR:-~/.pi/agent}/pi-chrome-devtools.json`:

```json
{
  "browser": {
    "endpoint": "http://127.0.0.1:9222",
    "autoLaunch": true,
    "executablePath": "/absolute/path/to/chromium"
  }
}
```

`browser.endpoint` must be an HTTP origin with an explicit port and no credentials, path, query, or
fragment. Omitting it keeps attach-first behavior on `127.0.0.1:9222` and lets a managed launch use
Chrome's dynamic DevTools port mode (`--remote-debugging-port=0`). Explicitly saving an endpoint pins
managed launches to that port. `browser.autoLaunch` defaults to `true`. `browser.executablePath` is
optional and must be an absolute path; when absent, normal browser discovery applies.

The configured endpoint must expose the standard CDP HTTP discovery routes such as `/json/version`
and `/json/list`. Chrome's newer built-in permission flow can listen on port `9222` while returning
`404` from those routes; setting the same HTTP origin does not by itself make that flow compatible.

### Unpacked extensions

> [!WARNING]
> An unpacked extension executes privileged browser code. Load only code you trust. Project settings
> are honored only when Pi reports the project as trusted.

Add trusted unpacked-extension paths to the same canonical user file:

```json
{
  "browser": {
    "executablePath": "/absolute/path/to/chrome-for-testing",
    "extensionPaths": [
      "/absolute/path/to/unpacked-extension-one",
      "/absolute/path/to/unpacked-extension-two"
    ]
  }
}
```

Every user-file path must be absolute. Each extension path must resolve to a directory containing a
valid `manifest.json` and cannot contain a comma because Chrome uses commas to separate multiple
startup paths. For extension-configured sessions, `executablePath` must identify Chrome for
Testing or Chromium. Branded Google Chrome is rejected because tested releases can silently ignore
unpacked-extension startup flags.

A trusted project can replace the user extension list in
`<workspace>/.pi/pi-chrome-devtools.json`. Relative paths resolve from the workspace (`ctx.cwd`):

```json
{
  "browser": {
    "extensionPaths": ["./extension"]
  }
}
```

Project `extensionPaths` replace, rather than append to, the user array. A project file cannot
override `browser.endpoint`, `browser.autoLaunch`, or `browser.executablePath`; browser connection
settings remain machine-owned user configuration. Effective precedence is defaults, user settings,
trusted project extension paths, then deprecated environment overrides. No new environment variable
is required.

When `extensionPaths` is non-empty, the extension skips attach-first behavior and starts an isolated,
extension-owned managed browser with `--disable-extensions-except` and `--load-extension`. It fails
before spawning when the endpoint is remote, auto-launch is disabled, an explicit port is occupied,
the executable is missing, or the browser product is unsupported. It never adds extensions to,
modifies, restarts, or closes an external browser.

Settings are loaded on session start. After editing JSON, use `/reload` or replace the session; the
old managed browser is closed before the new configuration is applied. Missing files preserve the
existing no-extension behavior. Invalid JSON, invalid browser values, and missing manifests are left
unchanged and ignored with an actionable warning.

### Deprecated environment overrides and manual endpoints

The existing `PI_CHROME_DEVTOOLS_HOST`, `PI_CHROME_DEVTOOLS_PORT`,
`PI_CHROME_DEVTOOLS_AUTO_LAUNCH`, and `PI_CHROME_DEVTOOLS_BROWSER` variables remain temporary
compatibility overrides. They still take precedence over JSON, but every session that sees one emits
a deprecation warning. Move their values to `browser.endpoint`, `browser.autoLaunch`, and
`browser.executablePath`; the variables will be removed in a future version.

Without unpacked extensions, browser discovery still checks platform-specific Chrome, Chromium,
Brave, and Microsoft Edge candidates. Manual launch remains available when no unpacked extensions are
configured:

```bash
google-chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir=/tmp/pi-chrome-devtools
```

On session shutdown, the extension terminates only browser processes it started and best-effort
removes their temporary profiles. It never closes user-started browsers or remote endpoints.

## 🛠️ Pi tools

- `chrome_devtools_load` — find and load browser capabilities relevant to a task.
- `chrome_devtools_list_pages` — list inspectable Chrome tabs/pages.
- `chrome_devtools_select_page` — select the active page for later tool calls.
- `chrome_devtools_navigate` — navigate a page to a URL; if no page exists, create one first.
- `chrome_devtools_evaluate` — evaluate JavaScript in the selected page.
- `chrome_devtools_screenshot` — capture a PNG screenshot and save it as a PNG file.

### Lazy tool loading

All six tools are registered, but only `chrome_devtools_load` starts active for this extension.

The loader accepts a task-oriented `query`, matches it against the five capability tools, and adds matching available tools without removing any active Pi tool.

Loaded capability tools remain active for the rest of the session unless the user makes them unavailable through `/chrome-devtools`.

Pi uses native deferred tool references on compatible Anthropic and OpenAI models.

Other models receive Pi's safe fallback: the newly active definitions appear in the normal tool list on the next model request.

The capability tools omit active-only prompt snippets so a lazy load does not rebuild the system prompt prefix.

The saved `tools` array controls which capabilities the loader may expose.

An empty array leaves the loader active but makes every browser capability unavailable.

### Screenshot files

`chrome_devtools_screenshot` always saves the captured PNG to disk. If `savePath` is omitted,
the extension writes a unique temp file such as:

```text
/tmp/pi-chrome-devtools-screenshot-<uuid>.png
```

Pass `savePath` to choose the output path:

```js
chrome_devtools_screenshot({
  fullPage: true,
  savePath: "artifacts/homepage.png",
});
```

Relative `savePath` values resolve from Pi's current working directory. A single leading `@`
is stripped to match Pi file-mention paths. Absolute paths are accepted only when they stay
inside the current working directory or the OS temp directory. Paths containing `..` segments,
NUL bytes, symlinked parent directories, directories as targets, final symbolic-link targets, or
other non-regular file targets are rejected. Existing regular files at the target path are
replaced. The tool result includes the resolved path, byte count, and an inline image block when
the active model/provider can consume images. If the model cannot inspect the inline image, ask it
to read the saved path, for example `read({ path: "artifacts/homepage.png" })`.

## 💬 Command

```text
/chrome-devtools
```

Opens a menu that shows the lazy catalog size, whether that catalog is saved, the configured
endpoint, the observed managed-browser state, and any settings or launch warning before you choose
an action. The five actions stay on one level:

- **Choose available browser tools…** — stage any combination of the five capabilities, then review
  the exact available/unavailable result before selecting **Apply tool changes**.
- **Make all browser tools available…** or **Make all browser tools unavailable…** — preview the
  context-appropriate bulk change before applying it.
- **Browser status** — inspect runtime, endpoint, launch mode, and the last launch attempt without
  probing the endpoint or starting Chrome.
- **Browser settings** — immediately save the endpoint, auto-launch policy, or browser executable;
  inspect unpacked-extension paths and effective sources. A deprecated environment override remains
  effective until removed even when its underlying JSON value changes.
- **Help** — view command usage and return to the menu.

In the tool screen, **Select all** and **Select none** are unambiguous shortcuts; individual rows use
friendly task labels while retaining their raw `chrome_devtools_*` identity in the description.
Toggles remain a command-local draft. **Review changes** previews the exact effect, **Apply tool
changes** saves it, and Cancel, Escape, Ctrl+C, disposal, or session replacement discards an
unconfirmed draft without changing runtime tools or settings. A failed apply restores the previous
availability and loaded-tool state, preserves the settings file, retains the draft for retry, and
reports how to recover.

Direct subcommands are also available:

```text
/chrome-devtools help
/chrome-devtools quickstart
/chrome-devtools status
/chrome-devtools settings
/chrome-devtools tools
/chrome-devtools toggle
/chrome-devtools enable
/chrome-devtools disable
```

Compatibility aliases remain available: `toggle` and `select` mean `tools`, `on` means `enable`, and
`off` means `disable`.

- `help` shows command usage.
- `quickstart` shows the configured CDP endpoint, endpoint source, auto-launch mode, browser
  candidates, last launch attempt, and launch hints.
- `status` shows available and loaded capability counts, loader state, the persisted catalog,
  settings file path, endpoint source, launch mode, last launch attempt, and active non-Chrome tool
  count.
- `settings` opens the same immediate-save browser settings flow used by the menu.
- `tools` opens the same staged, width-safe availability and review flow used by the menu.
- `toggle` and `select` are compatibility aliases for `tools`.
- `enable` makes all five capability tools available to the loader and saves that catalog; `on` is a
  compatibility alias.
- `disable` makes all five capability tools unavailable and saves the empty catalog; `off` is a
  compatibility alias. The slash command and `chrome_devtools_load` remain available.

The menu, `settings`, `tools`, `help`, `quickstart`, and `status` require TUI or RPC mode so their
result is observable. TUI uses keyboard navigation and injected Pi keybindings; RPC receives
equivalent standard dialogs. In print and JSON modes, interactive and informational routes reject
explicitly instead of silently opening unavailable UI. The immediate `enable`/`disable` routes remain
available for deterministic non-interactive use.

## ⚙️ Settings

The available capability names are saved to:

```text
${PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR:-~/.pi/agent}/pi-chrome-devtools.json
```

The same file owns `browser.endpoint`, `browser.autoLaunch`, `browser.executablePath`, and
`browser.extensionPaths`. Browser connection fields are machine-owned user settings; trusted project
files may replace only `browser.extensionPaths`. Confirmed menu changes apply before the next browser
connection and close only an extension-owned managed browser. Manual JSON edits and unpacked-extension
changes apply after `/reload` or session replacement.

When the file is missing or invalid, the extension preserves Pi's current Chrome DevTools
availability policy instead of replacing it. A valid saved catalog is restored on Pi startup and
`/reload`, while its capability definitions remain deferred. A missing file is created by the first
confirmed browser or tool setting. Within one Pi process, all browser and tool saves run in invocation
order, reread the latest valid document, publish by temporary-file rename, and preserve unknown
fields. Malformed JSON or invalid recognized fields make menu mutation unavailable and block direct
saves without replacement; a failed save restores the prior displayed and effective state.

Compatibility: older versions used `pi-chrome-devtools-settings.json`. A legacy-only file remains
readable with a warning and is never modified automatically; rename it to
`pi-chrome-devtools.json`. The first subsequent settings save writes the canonical file. If both
files exist, `pi-chrome-devtools.json` wins and the legacy file is ignored. The legacy
filename is deprecated and will be removed in a future major release.

## 🧠 Use cases

- Debug front-end applications with an AI coding agent.
- Verify DOM state after code changes.
- Capture screenshots for visual inspection.
- Drive local browser workflows without a separate MCP server.
- Combine with Pi coding tools for end-to-end web app fixes.
